connectFourAI
=============

This is a Connect Four AI I made with JavaScript that uses a minimax algorithm to find the best available move based on
a scoring heuristic.  It is a simple minimax so it does miss some moves, but performs pretty well overall.  To keep the
files organized I used Browserify.
