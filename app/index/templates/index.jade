      |  I have been using web technologies for the past two years, writing
      |  in languages such as Javascript, HTML5, CSS, .Net, PHP, SQL, and Bash.
      |  I have built and maintained websites built on top of completely custom
      |  .Net frameworks, the eCommerce platform Magento, and 
      |  my own Node.js MVC framework from which these pages are served.
      |  I am a certified Magento developer and have written many modules 
      |  including ones specifically designed for a business's own routing and
      |  delivery logic.  I am interested in Game Engines and hope to one day
      |  build a game that people enjoy.
